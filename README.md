# Notice of Abandonment
Due to the scope of this project (required for the wall) being larger than hoped, it is impracticle for a single developer (Milo Banks, the sole author) to create this engine in a suitable amount of time. This repository will feature no further commits. If it does, then this project has started back up. This may happen at the authors descretion, but there is a *very real* possibility that it will not.

A stupid simple and fast game engine. Lacks features. Made for that big blank wall in the hallway. Named after Pong spelled backwards. Has an unintensional mispelling.

*Gomp is to features what this readme is to linguistic flair.*
