# Notice of Abandonment
This project has sense been abandoned. It would simply take to long (with a one person development team, that is) to feasibly create a game engine with suitable complexity for its desired use case. This project may be started back up, but only at the authors descresion.

A stupid simple and fast game engine. Lacks features. Made for that big blank wall in the hallway. Named after Pong spelled backwards. Has an unintensional mispelling.

*Gomp is to features what this readme is to linguistic flair.*
