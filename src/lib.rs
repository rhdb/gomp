//! # Welcome
//!
//! Gomp is a simple game engine. Like really simple. Currently, it only supports 2D and only a few
//! components. It is designed to be fast, so everything is well optimised (to the best of the
//! authors ability). You can see examples in the example repository, or just look through this
//! documentation to see some examples for the modules included in this crate.
